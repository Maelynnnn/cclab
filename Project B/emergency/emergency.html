        <div class="box">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of LAB3's most serious cases, case code 519-471.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 1, 2024, Alternate2 & Alternate3 killed Dr. Thomas Bhing, 
                escaped the LAB3 Bio-Regulation Room, and their whereabouts are still unknown.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given Alternate's ability to self-replicate and its demonstrated intent to replace humans, 
                this case should be upgraded to Bio-Leak level. However, LAB3 concealed the matter from the outside world in order to avoid prosecution 
                by the United Government. Those who know about it have all been "optimized".
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were on the verge of finding me, and I knew my days were numbered. 
                That's why I stole the relevant information about this case from the highest archive, hoping to pass on the secret.

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I know that Alternate has abilities far superior to those of humans, 
                and has shown intent to attack humans to replace them. Therefore, the consequences of the leak of Alternate No.2 & No.3 are unimaginable. 
                It is possible that a thousand years from now, when you are browsing this website at this very moment, the people around you may not be human. 
                I can't even guarantee that you are a real human being.
