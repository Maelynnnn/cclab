                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Satricks have been observed in groups, and are only seen at night, floating back and forth in the night sky, occasionally stopping to rest and rotating their limbs when they are excited. Satrick will make the world go from night to day by spinning himself to emit light, but this process will also cause Satrick to gradually die until the next night, when new Satricks are born.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Satrck's body is very bright at night, has four tentacles that can float and move, and his brain is protected in the middle of his limbs.Satrick's limbs are very flexible, allowing him to swim and rotate at multiple angles. The smaller Satrick's body is red in color to protect itself and confuse its enemies. Larger Satricks have white bodies.</p>

                There is currently no way for a Satrick Star to successfully survive the Blackout, and even if they don't spin they will gradually die, which seems to be their fate. However, they are very fertile, with new Satrick Stars appearing with each new night, so there's no need to worry about them becoming extinct for the time being.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Don't touch Satrick Star! Since they live in the sky, their bodies are likely to be extremely hot, just watch them quietly. Respect the sacrifices made by the Satrick Stars, who gave their lives to bring light to the world.
